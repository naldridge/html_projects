        <h1>The Story of King Thrushbeard</h1>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>1. The Picky Princess</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            A king had a daughter who was beautiful beyond all measure,<BR>
            but so proud and haughty withal that no suitor was good<BR>
            enough for her. She sent away one after the other, and<BR>
            ridiculed them as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once the king made a great feast and invited thereto, from far<BR>
            and near, all the young men likely to marry. They were all<BR>
            marshalled in a row according to their rank and standing. First<BR>
            came the kings, then the grand-dukes, then the princes, the<BR>
            earls, the barons, and the gentry. Then the king's daughter was<BR>
            led through the ranks, but to each one she had some objection<BR>
            to make. One was too fat, the wine-barrel, she said. Another<BR>
            was too tall, long and thin has little in. The third was too<BR>
            short, short and thick is never quick. The fourth was too<BR>
            pale, as pale as death. The fifth too red, a fighting cock.<BR>
            The sixth was not straight enough, a green log dried behind<BR>
            the stove.
        </p>
        <p>
            So she had something to say against each one, but she made<BR>
            herself especially merry over a good king who stood quite<BR>
            high up in the row, and whose chin had grown a little crooked.<BR>
            Look, she cried and laughed, he has a chin like a thrush's<BR>
            beak. And from that time he got the name of king thrushbeard.<BR>
        </p>
        <p>
            But the old king, when he saw that his daugher did nothing<BR>
            but mock the people, and despised all the suitors who were<BR>
            gathered there, was very angry, and swore that she should have<BR>
            for her husband the very first beggar that came to his doors.<BR>
        </p>

        <h2>2. Beggar Beginnings</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            A few days afterwards a fiddler came and sang beneath the<BR>
            windows, trying to earn a few pennies. When the king heard him<BR>
            he said, let him come up. So the fiddler came in, in his dirty,<BR>
            ragged clothes, and sang before the king and his daughter, and<BR>
            when he had ended he asked for a trifling gift. The king said,<BR>
            your song has pleased me so well that I will give you my<BR>
            daughter there, to wife.
        </p>
        <p>
            The king's daughter shuddered, but the king said, I have taken<BR>
            an oath to give you to the very first beggar-man and I will keep<BR>
            it. All she could say was in vain. The priest was brought,<BR>
            and she had to let herself be wedded to the fiddler on the<BR>
            spot. When that was done the king said, now it is not proper<BR>
            for you, a beggar-woman, to stay any longer in my palace, you may<BR>
            just go away with your husband.
        </p>
        <p>
            The beggar-man led her out by the hand, and she was obliged to<BR>
            walk away on foot with him. When they came to a large forest<BR>
            she asked, to whom does that beautiful forest belong. It<BR>
            belongs to king thrushbeard. If you had taken him, it would<BR>
            have been yours. Ah, unhappy girl that I am, if I had but taken<BR>
            king thrushbeard.
        </p>
        <p>
            Afterwards they came to a meadow, and she asked again, to whom<BR>
            does this beautiful green meadow belong. It belongs to king<BR>
            thrushbeard. If you had taken him, it would have been<BR>
            yours. Ah, unhappy girl that I am, if I had but taken king<BR>
            thrushbeard.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then they came to a large town, and she asked again, to whom<BR>
            does this fine large town belong. It belongs to king thrushbeard.<BR>
            If you had taken him, it would have been yours. Ah, unhappy<BR>
            girl that I am, if I had but taken king thrushbeard.<BR>
            It does not please me, said the fiddler, to hear you always<BR>
            wishing for another husband. Am I not good enough for you.<BR>
        </p>
        <p>
            At last they came to a very little hut, and she said, oh<BR>
            goodness. What a small house. To whom does this miserable,<BR>
            tiny hovel belong. The fiddler answered, that is my house and<BR>
            yours, where we shall live together.<BR>
        </p>
        <p>
            She had to stoop in order to go in at the low door. Where are<BR>
            the servants, said the king's daughter. What servants, answered<BR>
            the beggar-man. You must yourself do what you wish to have done.<BR>
            Just make a fire at once, and set on water to cook my supper,<BR>
            I am quite tired. But the king's daughter knew nothing about<BR>
            lighting fires or cooking, and the beggar-man had to lend a<BR>
            hand himself to get anything fairly done. When they had<BR>
            finished their scanty meal they went to bed. But he forced<BR>
            her to get up quite early in the morning in order to look after<BR>
            the house.<BR>
        </p>

        <h2>3. Domestic Drudgery</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            For a few days they lived in this way as well as might be, and<BR>
            came to the end of all their provisions. Then the man said,<BR>
            wife, we cannot go on any longer eating and drinking here and<BR>
            earning nothing. You must make baskets. He went out, cut some<BR>
            willows, and brought them home. Then she began to make baskets,<BR>
            but the tough willows wounded her delicate hands.<BR>
        </p>
        <p>
            I see that this will not do, said the man. You had better spin,<BR>
            perhaps you can do that better. She sat down and tried to spin,<BR>
            but the hard thread soon cut her soft fingers so that the blood<BR>
            ran down. See, said the man, you are fit for no sort of work.<BR>
            I have made a bad bargain with you. Now I will try to make a<BR>
            business with pots and earthenware. You must sit in the<BR>
            market-place and sell the ware. Alas, thought she, if any of<BR>
            the people from my father's kingdom come to the market and see<BR>
            me sitting there, selling, how they will mock me. But it was<BR>
            of no use, she had to yield unless she chose to die of hunger.<BR>
            For the first time she succeeded well, for the people were glad<BR>
            to buy the woman's wares because she was good-looking, and<BR>
            they paid her what she asked. Many even gave her the money and<BR>
            left the pots with her as well. So they lived on what she had<BR>
            earned as long as it lasted, then the husband bought a lot of<BR>
            new crockery. With this she sat down at the corner of the<BR>
            market-place, and set it out round about her ready for sale.<BR>
            But suddenly there came a drunken hussar galloping along, and<BR>
            he rode right amongst the pots so that they were all broken into<BR>
            a thousand bits. <BR>
        </p>
        <p>
            She beganto weep, and did now know what to do for fear. Alas,<BR>
            what willhappen to me, cried she. What will my husband say to<BR>
            this. She ran home and told him of the misfortune. Who would <BR>
            seat herself at a corner of the market-place with crockery, said<BR>
            the man. Leave off crying, I see very well that you cannot<BR>
            do any ordinary work, so I have been to our king's palace and<BR>
            have asked whether they cannot find a place for a kitchen-maid,<BR>
            and they have promised me to take you. In that way you will<BR>
            get your food for nothing.<BR>
        </p>
        <p>
            The king's daughter was now a kitchen-maid, and had to be at<BR>
            the cook's beck and call, and do the dirtiest work. In both her<BR>
            pockets she fastened a little jar, in which she took home her<BR>
            share of the leavings, and upon this they lived.<BR>
        </p>

        <h2>4. Joyous Jubilation</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            It happened that the wedding of the king's eldest son was to be<BR>
            celebrated, so the poor woman went up and placed herself by<BR>
            the door of the hall to look on. When all the candles were lit,<BR>
            and people, each more beautiful than the other, entered, and<BR>
            all was full of pomp and splendor, she thought of her lot with<BR>
            a sad heart, and cursed the pride and haughtiness which had<BR>
            humbled her and brought her to so great poverty.<BR>
        </p>
        <p>
            The smell of the delicious dishes which were being taken in<BR>
            and out reached her, and now and then the servants threw her<BR>
            a few morsels of them. These she put in her jars to take home.<BR>
        </p>
        <p>
            All at once the king's son entered, clothed in velvet and silk,<BR>
            with gold chains about his neck. And when he saw the<BR>
            beautiful woman standing by the door he seized her by the hand,<BR>
            and would have danced with her. But she refused and shrank<BR>
            with fear, for she saw that it was king thrushbeard, her<BR>
            suitor whom she had driven away with scorn. Her struggles<BR>
            were of no avail, he drew her into the hall. But the string<BR>
            by which her pockets were hung broke, the pots fell down, the<BR>
            soup ran out, and the scraps were scattered all about. And<BR>
            when the people saw it, there arose general laughter and<BR>
            derision, and she was so ashamed that she would rather have<BR>
            been a thousand fathoms below the ground. She sprang to the<BR>
            door and would have run away, but on the stairs a man caught<BR>
            her and brought her back. And when she looked at him it was<BR>
            king thrushbeard again. He said to her kindly, do not be<BR>
            afraid, I and the fiddler who has been living with you in that<BR>
            wretched hovel are one. For love of you I disguised myself<BR>
            so. And I also was the hussar who rode through your crockery.<BR>
            This was all done to humble your proud spirit, and to punish<BR>
            you for the insolence with which you mocked me.<BR>
        </p>
        <p>
            Then she wept bitterly and said, I have done great wrong, and<BR>
            am not worthy to be your wife. But he said, be comforted,<BR>
            the evil days are past. Now we will celebrate our wedding.<BR>
            Then the maids-in-waiting came and put on her the most splendid<BR>
            clothing, and her father and his whole court came and wished<BR>
            her happiness in her marriage with king thrushbeard, and<BR>
            the joy now began in earnest. I wish you and I had been there<BR>
            too.<BR>
